This was the first computation assignment of the M.Sc. Its topic revolved around collecting and processing Tweets about the current Covid-19 pandemic.
Specific programming aspects covered:

- Navigating the Twitter API to collect tweets.
- Use Pandas to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the collected tweets.
- Use of regular expressions to process the tweeets.
- Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot some results.

The folder contains the code in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, as well as an HTML. It also contains the 50,000 tweets that were collected, for reproducibility.
