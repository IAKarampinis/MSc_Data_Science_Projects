This was the second hands-on Assignment of the Course and the programme in general. It was more involved than the first and covered more in depth aspects of data processing and visualization. The project was broken down in 3 parts.

- <p align="justify"> Task 1 involved exploratory data analysis on data with missing values or of the wrong type. A particulary interesting task here was to fill the missing values in a such a way "that will not affect the variance of that column" (Task 1E). The intention here, as was later explained by the tutor, was to simply use the mean value of the column, however, due to the exceedingly high variance of certain columns, this was not always an acceptable approximation. This gave me the opportunity to think outside the box and find innovative solutions for the problem at hand. </p>
